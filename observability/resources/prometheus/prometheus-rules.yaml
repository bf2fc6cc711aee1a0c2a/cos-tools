              This is an alert meant to ensure that the entire alerting pipeline
              is functional.
              This alert is always firing, therefore it should always be firing
              in Alertmanager
              and always fire against a receiver. There are integrations with
              various notification
              mechanisms that send a notification when this alert is not firing.
              For example the
              "DeadMansSnitch" integration in PagerDuty.
